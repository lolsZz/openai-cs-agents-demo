# 🏆 Amazon Q Hackathon: Agent Orchestration MCP Server

## 🎯 **Challenge**
Extend Amazon Q's capability to tap into the power of agent orchestration by converting the OpenAI CS Agents Demo into a native Amazon Q MCP Server.

## 🚀 **Our Solution: "Amazon Q Agent Orchestra"**

Transform the sophisticated customer service agent system into an MCP server that gives Amazon Q multi-agent orchestration superpowers!

### **Core Innovation**
- **MCP Server Integration**: Native Amazon Q tool integration
- **Agent Orchestration**: Multiple specialized AI agents working together
- **Intelligent Routing**: Smart handoffs between agents based on context
- **Guardrail System**: Built-in safety and relevance checks
- **Context Preservation**: Persistent conversation state across agents

## 🏗️ **Architecture**

### **Phase 1: MCP Server Foundation**
```
Amazon Q CLI
    ↓ (MCP Protocol)
Agent Orchestra MCP Server
    ↓ (Agent Orchestration)
Specialized Agents:
├── Triage Agent (Router)
├── Seat Booking Agent
├── Flight Status Agent  
├── FAQ Agent
└── Cancellation Agent
```

### **Phase 2: Amazon Q Integration**
- Replace OpenAI API → Amazon Q's Claude model
- Integrate with user's development context
- Add file system integration for conversation logs
- Leverage existing Amazon Q context hooks

### **Phase 3: Enhanced Features**
- AWS service integration for real data
- GitHub integration for issue tracking
- Development environment awareness
- Custom agent types for developer workflows

## 🛠️ **MCP Tools Exposed**

| Tool | Purpose | Input | Output |
|------|---------|-------|--------|
| `start_customer_service_session` | Initialize new conversation | customer_info | session_id |
| `send_message_to_agents` | Main orchestration | session_id, message | agent_response, routing_info |
| `get_session_status` | Check conversation state | session_id | current_agent, context |
| `list_available_agents` | Show agent capabilities | - | agents_list |
| `trigger_handoff` | Manual agent switching | session_id, target_agent | handoff_result |
| `run_guardrail_check` | Test safety measures | message | guardrail_results |

## 🎯 **Hackathon Advantages**

## 🎉 **Demo Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: Customer Service Flow**
```
User: "I need to change my seat and check my flight status"
→ Triage Agent: Routes to Seat Booking Agent
→ Seat Booking Agent: Handles seat change, then routes to Flight Status Agent
→ Flight Status Agent: Provides flight information
→ Result: Multi-agent workflow with intelligent routing
```

### **Scenario 2: Developer Workflow** (Future Enhancement)
```
User: "Review my code, then help me deploy it"
→ Triage Agent: Routes to Code Review Agent
→ Code Review Agent: Analyzes code, then routes to Deployment Agent
→ Deployment Agent: Handles AWS deployment
→ Result: Development workflow automation
```
